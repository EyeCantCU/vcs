Hello, Universe!

This is simply a placeholder for what's to come. I'm working on a version control system for open source projects in the C++ programming language. If anyone would like to assist me in this endeavour, feel free to contact me. I will get back to you.

For now, this is completely an educational project that I am working on. I don't intend, nor do I want to, make anything that would ever suffice as a replacement for git, but rather, my goal here is just to build skills with C++ and expand on what I know before moving on to other languages.

Thanks,

RJ Sampson
